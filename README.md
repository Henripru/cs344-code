## CS 344 - Artificial Intelligence

This is sample code for
[CS 344 at Calvin College](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/kvlinden).
For details, see the
[course schedule](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/336/kvlinden/schedule.html).

### Getting Started

To use this code, do the following:
1. Create your own CS 344 code repo on GitHub:
`https://github.com/GITHUB_ID/cs336`
2. Clone this quick-start repo to your local machine.
3. Add a second git remote to this new local copy pointing to your new
GitHub repo and then commit/push this code to that repo.
For details on this process, see
[Git Basics - Working with Remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes).

You will generally work with this initial copy in your own repo.
If we make changes to this quick-start code, we will let you know what's
changed so that you can pull/merge those changes (from the original remote)
into your own code.
